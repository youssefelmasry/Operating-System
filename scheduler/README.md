# Scheduler Policies
Here are the implementation of five scheduler policies which are <br>
1- first come first serve (FCFS) <br>
2- shortest job first (SJF)- Non preemptive <br>
3- shortest remaining time first (SRTF) - preemptive <br>
4- Round Robin <br>
5- earliest deadline first (EDF) - preemptive without period <br><br>
Each one is in a file, and all of them are in scheduler file
<h2> constraints </h2>
This scheduler assums that the arrival time is in order
